Patient Distribution by Age:																			
The number of patients increases with age, peaking around the ages of 55 to 59. This indicates a growing number of patients as age increases, particularly noticeable from age 40 onwards.																			
There is a relatively stable number of patients from the age of 20 to 40, with minor fluctuations.																			
Insights:																			
Higher Prevalence Among Older Females:																			
The data shows a clear trend of increasing patient numbers as age increases, particularly significant in the age range from 40 to 59. This could imply that health issues or conditions requiring medical attention are more prevalent among older females.																			
Actionable Insights:																			
Targeted Healthcare Programs:																			
																			
Healthcare providers and policymakers should focus on creating targeted programs for older female populations, especially those in their late 40s and 50s, as they represent a significant portion of the patient base.																			
Preventive healthcare and routine check-ups should be emphasized for middle-aged and older women to manage and mitigate age-related health issues effectively.																			
Resource Allocation:																			
																			
Clinics and hospitals may need to allocate more resources and specialized care for the aging female population, given the higher demand from these age groups.
